# TwoSumFinder

Two Sum - C#, ALGORITHMIC, THINKING, SEARCHING
        Function that, given a list and a target sum, returns zero-based indices of any two elements 
        whose sum is equal to the target sum. If there are no such elements, the function will return null.

        For example, FindTwoSum(new List<int>() { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }, 12) should return a Tuple<int, int> 
        containing any of the following pairs of indices:

        1 and 4 (3 + 9 = 12)
        2 and 3 (5 + 7 = 12)
        3 and 2 (7 + 5 = 12)
        4 and 1 (9 + 3 = 12)
